# Who?
Hey! My name is Mike Varano. I'm a software engineer. I grew up in my personal favorite city in the world, Detroit, MI, and went to the University of Michigan. I like making websites, video games, and other cool stuff. 

Here's some of the work I've done.

# Stuff I've done 

## This Website
This website is a static [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/), hosted by the awesome people at GitHub. You can see the un-minified version of the repo [here](https://github.com/migreva/migreva.github.io). 

I'll eventually have a blog post that goes over some of the details about the site.

## Video Games
### B1G Ten Brawl
I made a couple games while at the University of Michigan. In my video game design class, our final project was a Super Smash Bros.-style fighting games centered around B1G Ten mascots, entitled Big Ten Brawl. Here's a gameplay video:

### Video Games + Autism Spectrum Disorder
Another class I took at the U of M ceneterd around making Kinect-based video games that were to be used to treat various symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The College of Engineering did a pretty cool video of the class, you can see that here:

The class was also featured in a [USA Today article](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/story/2012-05-31/video-games-%20autism-students/55319452/1?csp=34news).

## Computer Education
My friend Luke and I took an Independent Study while studying Computer Science at the Univeristy of Michigan that centered around iOS app development and computer education. The end result was an iOS app centered around studying, with our demo version being Computer Science centered. 

Luke wrote a pretty cool post about it [here](http://lukezilioli.com/blog/?id=19).

## Web Sites
I currently work at [Qualcomm](http://www.qualcomm.com/) doing some app development on a couple of Django-powered web apps. Working with a Python-based web framework has been great, I think everyone should have a little Python in their lives.

## Resume
Thank's for reading this far. I have a [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ca8d3gcj4ugpjg9/resume.pdf) if you're into that sort of thing. I'm on the internet in all sorts of places. You can get links to my Twitter, GitHub, StackOverflow, Spotify (my personal favorite) below.
