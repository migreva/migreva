# Who?
Hey! My name is Mike Varano. I'm a software engineer. I went to the University of Michigan. I like making websites, video games, and other cool stuff. 

Here's some of the work I've done.

# Stuff I've done 

## This Website
This website is a static [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/), hosted by the awesome people at GitHub. You can see the un-minified version of the repo [here](https://github.com/migreva/migreva.github.io). 

I'll eventually have a [blog](http://migreva.com/#blog) post that goes over some of the details about the site.

## Video Games
I made a couple games while at the University of Michigan. Our final project was a Super Smash Bros.-style fighting games centered around B1G Ten mascots, entitled Big Ten Brawl. Here's a gameplay video:

## Computer Education
My friend Luke and I took an Independent Study while studying Computer Science at the Univeristy of Michigan that centered around iOS app development and computer education. The end result was an iOS app centered around studying, with our demo version being Computer Science centered. 

Luke wrote a pretty cool post about it [here](http://lukezilioli.com/blog/?id=19). I should have one up soon.

## Web Sites
I currently work at [Qualcomm](http://www.qualcomm.com/) doing some app development on a couple of Django-powered web apps. Working with a Python-based web framework has been great, I think everyone should have a little Python in their lives.

## Resume
Thank's for reading this far. I have a Resume <need link for resume> if you're into that sort of thing. I'm on the internet in all sorts of places. You can get links to my Twitter, GitHub, StackOverflow, Spotify (my personal favorite) below.
